Last week, we shipped a package to 123 Oak Street, Austin, TX 73301. The recipient confirmed that they received it, but the delivery was delayed due to a ZIP code error. Next time, we will double-check the address before sending. For example, we might also use 456 Pine Ave, Austin, TX 73301-1234, to ensure proper delivery.
Yesterday, I received an order from our New York office. The package was sent from 789 Broadway, New York, NY 10001. Interestingly, the same address was written on two different labels, one with 'Broadway' fully written out and the other with 'Broadway St.' Despite this, the package arrived on time. I also noticed that they use a different ZIP code for their backup warehouse at 987 Elm St, Brooklyn, NY 11215.
We are also preparing a shipment to Los Angeles, specifically to 321 Maple Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90012-3456. However, last month, they requested the shipment be sent to 654 Cedar Blvd, Santa Monica, CA 90405, which is another one of their offices. For international shipments, our partner office in Toronto, Canada, located at 12 King Street, Toronto, ON M5H 1A1, handles everything smoothly.

Finally, we got a request to send documentation to a law firm located at 234 Willow Lane, Washington, DC 20002. They asked us to double-check the address because in the past, the ZIP code was mistyped as '20001' instead of '20002'.

Last week, our logistics department shipped an important package to 123 Oak Street, Austin, TX 73301. Upon review, we realized that this address had been used in several past orders, including a shipment last month to 123 Oak St, Austin, Texas 73301. Interestingly, despite the minor differences in how the address was written, both packages arrived at the same destination.

In another case, we encountered an issue when we mistakenly sent documents to 123 Oak Street, Austin, omitting the ZIP code. Fortunately, the local courier was able to locate the recipient since the address was well-known in the area.

Additionally, one of our clients provided an alternative version of the address as 123 Oak St, Austin, TX, during a recent telephone conversation. Even without the ZIP code, they confirmed that it matched the previous deliveries.

Later, we received a confirmation for a third-party audit report, which also listed 123 Oak Street, Austin. However, this time the ZIP code was slightly different: 73301-4567. After verifying with the client, they clarified that this was their backup ZIP code, used interchangeably with 73301.

During our annual review meeting, the legal team referenced several past contracts where they had sent documentation to 123 Oak Street, Austin, TX 73301-4567. In a few records, the address was even shortened to just Oak St, Austin due to space limitations in the forms.

Despite the variations, every version of 123 Oak Street has consistently pointed to the same office building in downtown Austin. Our suppliers from Los Angeles also mentioned that they had recently sent invoices to Oak Street, Austin, TX, using their systemâ€™s standardized format for addresses. They didn't include the street number but ensured the delivery reached the correct location.

Finally, in our customer support records, we found correspondence where the address appeared as Oak St, Austin, 73301, and in another instance, it was simply written as Austin, TX 73301, relying on the postal service to resolve the missing details.
